# MEV Pirates

A decentralized MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) opportunity detector and builder network enabler.

## Overview

MEV Pirates is a tool that monitors the Ethereum mempool for high-value MEV opportunities, specifically focusing on DEX (Decentralized Exchange) transactions with significant slippage. The project consists of two main components:

1. A backend system that decodes and analyzes transactions from popular DEXs such as Uniswap and 1inch
2. A frontend dashboard that visualizes MEV opportunities and enables verified humans to access the API

By integrating with WorldCoin's identity verification, MEV Pirates promotes the decentralization of the builder network while prioritizing human transactions, supporting the broader initiative by WorldCoin and Flashbots (rollup-boost).

## Architecture

### Backend (`actual-scripts-js`)

The backend monitors the Ethereum mempool using a full node (reth+lighthouse) and:

- Decodes Uniswap (V2, V3, V4) and 1inch router transactions
- Uses Uniswap V3's quote contract to calculate the expected output amount
- Computes transaction slippage by comparing quoted amounts with transaction parameters
- Categorizes transactions by slippage potential (VERY_LOW, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, VERY_HIGH)
- Stores decoded transaction data in a ClickHouse database

### Frontend (mev-dashboard)

The dashboard provides:

- Real-time monitoring of high-value MEV opportunities
- Distribution charts for slippage categories and DEX activity
- API access for verified humans via WorldCoin integration
- Historical trends of MEV opportunities

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- Access to an Ethereum node (RPC endpoint)
- ClickHouse database instance
- Firebase account (for hosting the dashboard)

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the scripts directory:
   ```bash
   cd actual-scripts-js
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure your environment variables for node connection and database
4. Start monitoring:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

### Dashboard Setup

1. Navigate to the dashboard directory:
   ```bash
   cd mev-dashboard
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Features

- **Transaction Decoding**: Accurate decoding of complex DEX transactions
- **Slippage Analysis**: Precise calculation of slippage percentages and MEV potential
- **Human Verification**: Integration with WorldCoin ID to verify human users
- **API Access**: Allow verified humans to query the database for MEV opportunities
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Visual representation of MEV activity and opportunities
- **Decentralized Builder Enablement**: Empowers anyone to start their own builder service

## How It Works

1. Scripts continuously monitor the mempool for new transactions
2. When a DEX transaction is detected, it's decoded to extract parameters
3. The transaction parameters are compared against current market quotes to calculate slippage
4. High-slippage transactions are flagged as potential MEV opportunities
5. Verified humans can access this data through the API to inform their builder strategies

MEV Pirates is an open initiative to decentralize the builder network. Contributions are welcome!
